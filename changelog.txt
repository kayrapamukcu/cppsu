   To do
-----------

# Refactor massive functions 
# Make a split helper (Why didn't i do this earlier...) 

db.cpp : update map imports & db reconstruction to update the screen (instead of not responding the whole time)
ingame.cpp : improve bezier slider rendering, unnecessary draws on corners
song_select.cpp : add right click on maps for good gui delete
		  add search function
		  improve background rendering (no scaling just crop, parallax effects)
settings.cpp : add an option for background rendering in-game
	       add an option for slider resolution for potentially better performance
	       add an option to toggle slider-end rendering
