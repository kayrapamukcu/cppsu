# cppsu!

An osu! client written with performance in mind, designed to run on old computers.\
I do eventually plan on making it work on Linux also.

NOTE: I'm limited to OpenGL 1.1, so do not expect this client to outperform osu!stable or osu!lazer on your main computer.

### Requirements:
Windows XP (not guaranteed to work at the moment; should work on 7 no matter what)\
An x86 processor with SSE2 support\
OpenGL 1.1



This README.md file will be updated as the project gets closer to completion.
